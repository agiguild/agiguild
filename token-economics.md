# $AGI token

Open Source AI Guild will steward the funding of research and rewarding of contributors with a cryptographic token, $AGI. 

There are two primary users/holders of $AGI: 
 - Open Source contributors are given $AGI for their work. Initial distribution will be based on past contributions to Open Source AI.
 - Companies with over $1m in revenue must acquire and stake $AGI to use software licensed under the AGI License. Through staking $AGI, value will accrue to all $AGI holders.

## Token distribution

Total supply: 10B

| Role | Percentage | Vesting |
| - | - | - |
| Initial distribution | 20% | 6 months |
| DAO | 80% | 4 years |

## Initial distribution

Initial distribution of $AGI is proposed to retroactively reward open source contributors and authors of papers weighted by citations.

There will be mistakes by automated process, so we encourage people who think they were omitted to apply for retroactive funding via DAO software.

The exact calculations are specified in (technical specification document)[./tech-spec.md].

## Staking & voting escrow

To become a member of Guild and have voting power, holder of $AGI must stake their token with selected duration. The goal is to have long term aligned members who are are in turn rewarded both by governance power and additional token rewards.

## Commercial use
As a company with less than $1M in annual revenue, you are encouraged to use all IP under the AGI License without restriction. We believe in helping startups leverage open source.

As a company with more than $1M in annual revenue, you must acquire and stake $AGI for at least 1 year proportional to annual revenue, to use all IP under the AGI License. The exact formula for how much $AGI must be staked is `X * max(0, AnnualRevenue - 1,000,000)`, where `X` is specified by the Guild, but suggesting to start at `0.001`. For example, a company that makes $2m in annual revenue must stake $1k of $AGI that year in order to use all of IP licensed by AGI Guild. When you stake $AGI, you become a voting member of the Guild. In addition to being able to use IP under the AGI License, the second primary benefit of being a voting member of the Guild is directly influencing where funding is directed. E.g. If you believe more funding should go towards debug tooling, you can do such. 

Acquiring and staking $AGI, is not an expense. It's an asset that goes on the balance sheet of the organization.
