Examples include but are not limited to the sale of products or services utilizing the software, the use of the software to provide services to third parties, and the integration of the Work into commercial offerings.

Transition to MIT:
After a period of 4 years, this license will automatically convert to a fully open-source license agreed upon by the AGI Guild, initially MIT, removing all commercial use restrictions and allowing unrestricted use of the software, including for commercial purposes.

Mandatory Conditions:
1. Copyright and License Inclusion: Every copy or derivative work of the software must include a visible copyright notice and a copy of this BSL.

Disputes arising under these terms will be handled through the agreed-upon AGI Guild arbitration process, as is set out TBD.
